			  <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
			<div class="half-width">
				<p>I started going to SNHU for IT Management. While I was attending University, I started taking coding classes at <a href="https://www.skillcrush.com" target="_BLANK">Skillcrush</a>. I realized my major was wrong and immediately switched to web development and design. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs. It goes back to the old saying "Choose a job you love and you will never work a day in your life"</p>
			</div>
			<div class="half-width">
				<p>The love for coding opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, efficient code</p>

				<h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>

				<h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
				<p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>
